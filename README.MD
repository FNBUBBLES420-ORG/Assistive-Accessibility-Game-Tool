# Assistive Accessibility Game Tool üéØ

Welcome to the Assistive Accessibility Game Tool project! This tool is designed to support individuals with disabilities by helping identify and aim at players within a game window using object detection.

## üß† What It Does

- Detects human targets using ONNX models (e.g. YOLOv5/YOLOv8).
- Aims towards detected targets using mouse simulation.
- Uses human-like smooth mouse movements for natural aiming.
- Configurable detection threshold and headshot mode.
- Includes masking and camera region selection features.
- Draws bounding boxes directly on the frame using OpenCV (no separate overlay module).

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Install Python
Use the provided script to install Python 3.11.9:
```bat
python3119.bat
```
This will download and install Python and set it in your system PATH.

### 2. Install Requirements
Make sure you install all required packages by running:
```bat
launcher.bat
```
This will execute `launcher.py`, which installs dependencies from `requirements.txt` and sets up the tool.

### 3. Edit and Save Your Configuration
Once the application is launched via `launcher.bat`, a graphical window will open.

1. Use the interface to open the `config.py` file.
2. Modify your settings (e.g. resolution, input keys, GPU type, etc.).
3. Click **Save** inside the GUI after editing the config so the changes take effect.

You must save the `config.py` before proceeding with running the tool.

### 4. Run the Main Application
After saving your configuration through the GUI, you can use:
```bat
launcher.bat
```
again to relaunch the main application with the updated configuration.

## ‚úÖ Required Python Packages (in `requirements.txt`)
```txt

# onnxruntime-directml==1.16.3
```

### üîß Configuration (`config.py` Example)
```python
from win32con import VK_RBUTTON

# Screen capture settings
screenShotHeight = 320
screenShotWidth = 320

# Mask settings
useMask = True
maskSide = "left"
maskWidth = 140
maskHeight = 240

# Autoaim settings
aaMovementAmp = 1.0
aaQuitKey = "8"
aaActivationKey = VK_RBUTTON
headshot_mode = True

# Confidence threshold
confidence = 0.25

# Serial communication settings
enableSerial = True
fallbackSerialPort = "COM3"
baudRate = 115200

# Display settings
cpsDisplay = True
visuals = True

# Target selection
centerOfScreen = True

# ONNX model settings
onnxProvider = 'CUDAExecutionProvider'
model_path = 'onnx-models/v5_mini_royale.onnx'
device = 'cuda'
fp16 = True
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Supported GPU Providers
Use the correct `onnxProvider` in `config.py` depending on your hardware:
- `'CUDAExecutionProvider'` ‚Äì for NVIDIA (requires CUDA 11.x and cuDNN)
- `'DmlExecutionProvider'` ‚Äì for AMD GPUs (requires DirectML)
- `'CPUExecutionProvider'` ‚Äì fallback for general use

## üß© System Overview
- Captures game feed using `dxcam` or `bettercam`
- Runs frame through ONNX model (e.g. YOLO)
- Filters detections via NMS
- Moves mouse for aim assist
- Renders bounding boxes using OpenCV (no overlay script required)

## ‚ùó Important Notes
- This software is intended as an **assistive tool** for gamers with physical or cognitive impairments.
- Part of the nonprofit initiative by **FNBubbles420 Org**, a registered 501(c)(3) charity.
